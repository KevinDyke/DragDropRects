DropDragRects is a small demonstration of drag and drop in WPF. The central rectangle can be set to the colour of the side rectangles. Hold down the left mouse button on a side rectangle. Then drag to the centre rectangle. Finally release the mouse button.

The button resets the cental rectangle to black.

Based on the application WPF Simple drag and drop operation (c#) by TheZara101 on youtube.
